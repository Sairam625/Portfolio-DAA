    <h1>Identified Business Cases</h1>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>1. Compact Dwelling for Temporary Rest</h2>
        <p>Design and develop compact living spaces near railway stations, metro stops, or bus terminals. These dwellings can serve as a convenient rest spot for travelers or commuters who need temporary accommodation. This can be particularly useful for individuals with long layovers or those traveling for work-related purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>2. Restricting Vehicles to Avoid Pollution</h2>
        <p>Implement vehicle restriction policies in selected areas, such as city centers or high-traffic zones, to reduce pollution. This can include measures like car-free zones, emission-based entry fees, or designated pedestrian-only areas. These strategies can significantly improve air quality and promote healthier urban environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>3. Multiple Modes for Purchasing Tickets</h2>
        <p>Offer a variety of ticketing options for public transportation, including buses, metro, and trains. This could involve physical ticket counters, vending machines, and digital platforms like mobile apps or online portals. Making tickets easily accessible enhances the convenience and inclusivity of public transport systems.</p>

    <h1>Multiple Modes for  Ticketing System</h1>
    <p>
        Among the identified business cases, I will be focusing and working on the third business case, which is to create multiple modes (counters) to purchase tickets for all public transports. 
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the Streets white paper, in 'Matheran', commuters travelling from Neral station need to stand in long queues for hours, even though if they arrive early. 
        Since our city is newly built, we aim to avoid such drawbacks in ticket distribution. 
        To achieve this, we will implement a multiple modes ticketing system using sorting algorithms (Merge Sort and Quick Sort) and the Divide and Conquer methodology. 
        Below is the proposed structure to address the issue effectively.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are multiple types of public transportation (e.g., buses, metros, and local trains).</li>
        <li>Each transport mode has its own set of routes, prices, and timings.</li>
        <li>Sorting algorithms will be applied to these modes of transportation data to provide an efficient way to search and sort available options based on user input.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage of Algorithmic Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
    <p>
        The entire ticketing system can be divided into smaller submodules such as buses, metro, and train ticket systems. Each system can be solved and optimized independently and then combined.
    </p>

    <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
    <p>
        Merge Sort will be used to sort available tickets for each transport mode (e.g., by price or timing).
    </p>

    <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
    <p>
        Quick Sort will be used for sorting real-time data, such as available tickets based on user queries (e.g., cheapest available route).

    <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>

    <h2>The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that perfectly aligns with implementing the above problem case is:</h2>

    <h3>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h3>

    <p>Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The specific targets and aspects of SDG 11 that align with your system include:</p>

    <h4>Target 11.2:</h4>
    <blockquote>
        “By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.”
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
        <li>By providing multiple modes (counters) for ticket purchases, the system improves accessibility, reduces wait times, and enhances user experience for diverse populations.</li>
        <li>It supports affordability and convenience by ensuring better and more equitable access to public transportation services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Target 11.6:</h4>
    <blockquote>
        “Reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.”
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
        <li>Streamlined ticketing for public transport encourages its use over private vehicles, helping reduce pollution and congestion in urban areas.</li>
        <li>By ensuring efficient, inclusive, and accessible ticketing systems, the proposed solution contributes to the broader objectives of SDG 11, fostering sustainable urban development.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Multiple Modes Ticketing System</h1>

<p>This document demonstrates the input and output for a ticketing system for public transportation, designed to handle multiple transport modes (bus, metro, and train). The system allows sorting of tickets based on user preferences using Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Data Loading from CSV Files</h2>
<div class="input-output">
    <h3>Input:</h3>
    <pre>
    The program loads ticket data from the following CSV files:
    - bus_tickets.csv
    - metro_tickets.csv
    - train_tickets.csv
    </pre>

    <h3>Output:</h3>
    <pre>
    After loading the files, the program will have the ticket data in memory, ready for sorting or adding new tickets.
    Data is stored in the following vectors:
    - busTickets
    - metroTickets
    - trainTickets
    </pre>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2. Manual Ticket Addition</h2>
<div class="input-output">
    <h3>Input:</h3>
    <pre>
    Question: "Do you want to add tickets manually? (yes/no)"
    User enters: yes
    
    For each transport mode (Bus, Metro, Train), the user is prompted for the following details:
    - Route Name (string)
    - Price (integer)
    - Time (integer)
    
    Example:
    Enter route name: Route D
    Enter price: 55
    Enter time in minutes: 40
    </pre>

    <h3>Output:</h3>
    <pre>
    After the user enters the data, the program stores the new tickets in the respective vectors.
    
    Example output:
    Add tickets for Bus:
    Enter route name: Route D
    Enter price: 55
    Enter time in minutes: 40
    
    Add tickets for Metro:
    Enter route name: Route F
    Enter price: 65
    Enter time in minutes: 50
    
    Add tickets for Train:
    Enter route name: Route H
    Enter price: 100
    Enter time in minutes: 70
    </pre>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>3. Sorting of Tickets</h2>
<div class="input-output">
    <h3>Input:</h3>
    <pre>
    Question: "Choose sorting method: \n1. Merge Sort\n2. Quick Sort\nEnter choice:"
    User enters: 1 (for Merge Sort)
    
    Question: "Choose sorting key: \n1. Price\n2. Time\nEnter choice:"
    User enters: 1 (for Price)
    </pre>

    <h3>Output:</h3>
    <pre>
    The system sorts the tickets based on the selected sorting method (Merge Sort) and key (Price). 
    
    Example sorted output for each transport mode (after sorting by price using Merge Sort):
    
    Sorted Tickets for Bus:
    Route: Route C, Price: 30, Time: 15 minutes
    Route: Route A, Price: 50, Time: 30 minutes
    Route: Route D, Price: 55, Time: 40 minutes
    Route: Route B, Price: 60, Time: 45 minutes
    
    Sorted Tickets for Metro:
    Route: Route D, Price: 40, Time: 20 minutes
    Route: Route E, Price: 70, Time: 35 minutes
    Route: Route F, Price: 65, Time: 50 minutes
    
    Sorted Tickets for Train:
    Route: Route G, Price: 80, Time: 50 minutes
    Route: Route F, Price: 90, Time: 60 minutes
    Route: Route H, Price: 100, Time: 70 minutes
    </pre>
