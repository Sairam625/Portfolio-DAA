    <h1>Urban Green Space Management for Sustainable Cities</h1>

    <h2>Business Case Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of urban green space management is to ensure that cities provide sufficient parks, recreational spaces, and green zones to enhance the quality of life for residents, maintain biodiversity, and promote environmental sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Efficient management of these spaces requires sophisticated algorithms to optimize their layout, accessibility, and sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithms for Green Space Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> 
            <p>Used for efficient management and searching of green space locations. It ensures quick insertion, deletion, and access to green space data.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong> 
            <p>Used to create a minimum spanning tree that connects green spaces in the most efficient way. It helps optimize the distribution and connectivity of parks and recreational areas.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Segment Tree:</strong> 
            <p>Used to efficiently query and update the total area of green spaces. It helps in managing and tracking the total area coverage in different geographical zones.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> 
            <p>Used to prioritize green spaces based on factors like usage frequency or ecological value. It ensures the highest priority green spaces are maintained and expanded first.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Input for the Code</h2>
    <p>The following green spaces and their usage or ecological value are provided:</p>
    <pre>
    Green Space 1: Park A, Usage: 100
    Green Space 2: Park B, Usage: 200
    Green Space 3: Park C, Usage: 150
    Green Space 4: Park D, Usage: 50
    </pre>

    <h2>Output for the Code</h2>
    <p>The results from running the algorithms are as follows:</p>
    <pre>
    Binary Search Tree (BST) Output:
    Green Space ID: 1, Name: Park A
    Green Space ID: 2, Name: Park B
    Green Space ID: 3, Name: Park C
    Green Space ID: 4, Name: Park D

    Kruskal's Algorithm Output:
    Connect Green Space 1 with Green Space 2 with weight 5
    Connect Green Space 2 with Green Space 3 with weight 2
    Connect Green Space 3 with Green Space 4 with weight 3

    Segment Tree Output:
    Query for total area in range [1, 3]: 270

    Heap Output:
    Green Space ID: 2, Usage: 200
    Green Space ID: 1, Usage: 100
    Green Space ID: 3, Usage: 150
    Green Space ID: 4, Usage: 50
