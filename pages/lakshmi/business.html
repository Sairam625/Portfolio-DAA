    <h1>Identified Business Cases</h1>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>1. Compact Dwelling for Temporary Rest</h2>
        <p>Design and develop compact living spaces near railway stations, metro stops, or bus terminals. These dwellings can serve as a convenient rest spot for travelers or commuters who need temporary accommodation. This can be particularly useful for individuals with long layovers or those traveling for work-related purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>2. Restricting Vehicles to Avoid Pollution</h2>
        <p>Implement vehicle restriction policies in selected areas, such as city centers or high-traffic zones, to reduce pollution. This can include measures like car-free zones, emission-based entry fees, or designated pedestrian-only areas. These strategies can significantly improve air quality and promote healthier urban environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>3. Multiple Modes for Purchasing Tickets</h2>
        <p>Offer a variety of ticketing options for public transportation, including buses, metro, and trains. This could involve physical ticket counters, vending machines, and digital platforms like mobile apps or online portals. Making tickets easily accessible enhances the convenience and inclusivity of public transport systems.</p>

    <title>Multiple Modes Ticketing System</title>

    <h1>Multiple Modes Ticketing System</h1>
    <p>
        Among the identified business cases, we will focus on the third business case, which is to create multiple modes (counters) to purchase tickets for all public transports. 
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the Streets white paper, in 'Matheran', commuters traveling from Neral station need to stand in long queues for hours, even if they arrive early. 
        Since our city is newly built, we aim to avoid such drawbacks in ticket distribution. 
        To achieve this, we will implement a multiple modes ticketing system using sorting algorithms (Merge Sort and Quick Sort) and the Divide and Conquer methodology. 
        Below is the proposed structure to address the issue effectively.
        
    </p>
    
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are multiple types of public transportation (e.g., buses, metros, and local trains).</li>
        <li>Each transport mode has its own set of routes, prices, and timings.</li>
        <li>Sorting algorithms will be applied to these modes of transportation data to provide an efficient way to search and sort available options based on user input.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage of Algorithmic Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
    <p>
        The entire ticketing system can be divided into smaller submodules such as buses, metro, and train ticket systems. Each system can be solved and optimized independently and then combined.
    </p>

    <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
    <p>
        Merge Sort will be used to sort available tickets for each transport mode (e.g., by price or timing).
    </p>

    <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
    <p>
        Quick Sort will be used for sorting real-time data, such as available tickets based on user queries (e.g., cheapest available route).
