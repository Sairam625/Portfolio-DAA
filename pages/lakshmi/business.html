        <h2>1. Compact Dwelling for Temporary Rest</h2>
        <p>Design and develop compact living spaces near railway stations, metro stops, or bus terminals. These dwellings can serve as a convenient rest spot for travelers or commuters who need temporary accommodation. This can be particularly useful for individuals with long layovers or those traveling for work-related purposes.</p>

    <div class="business-case">
        <h2>2. Restricting Vehicles to Avoid Pollution</h2>
        <p>Implement vehicle restriction policies in selected areas, such as city centers or high-traffic zones, to reduce pollution. This can include measures like car-free zones, emission-based entry fees, or designated pedestrian-only areas. These strategies can significantly improve air quality and promote healthier urban environments.</p>

        <h2>3. Multiple Modes for Purchasing Tickets</h2>
        <p>Offer a variety of ticketing options for public transportation, including buses, metro, and trains.

Making tickets easily accessible enhances the convenience and inclusivity of public transport systems.</p>
