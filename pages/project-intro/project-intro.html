            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The project addresses urban infrastructure optimization. Using concepts from the course, we analyzed
                white papers on smart city designs to identify critical business problems, such as efficient
                transportation systems(as PH sir has experienced in mumbai), waste management, and energy distribution.

                    <p class="first"> <b>"ANANDNAGARI"-THE CITY OF JOY</b> <br>

                        Our developed city is located in India.
                        Through this project , we explore key areas such as land use,
                        transportation systems, energy efficient architecture and waste management.
                        The total allotted area for developing this city is 1500sq.km
                        Among the total we have divided the land based on public needs:
                        35%-residence,10%-commercial,10%-industries,5%-greenspace,10%-social
                        10%-agriculture,10%-transport and 10%-tourism .Approximate budget required
                        for developing the city is 7,90,000cr.
