          1.Through this course, we learned to tackle complex problems using various algorithmic techniques, such as
          iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Emphasis was placed on analyzing time and space complexity to
          determine efficient solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="first">
          *For example, tree data structures like AVL and Red-Black Trees proved invaluable for hierarchical data
          management,
          while graph algorithms motivates us to model real-world scenarios like transportation networks and
          resource allocation.

          2.we have saw Sorting and searching algorithms i think they are explored for their critical role in
          database management and query optimization.
          The course highlighted how choosing the right approach, balancing constraints, and recognizing patterns
          can lead to
          innovative solutions.
