      <h1>Business Case for Anandnagari Bus System(mapping to SDG 11.2 targert)</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>1. Business Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide affordable and efficient public transport to all residents.</li>
        <li>To ensure that mobility is safe, accessible, and sustainable.</li>
        <li>To reduce the environmental impact of private transportation by offering a cleaner alternative.</li>
        <li>To provide a reliable and efficient system that supports economic activity and social inclusion.</li>
        <li>To improve connectivity and make transportation accessible to vulnerable groups (such as children, elderly, and disabled persons).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The target audience for the bus transport system includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily commuters, including students, employees, and workers.</li>
        <li>Vulnerable groups, including women, children, elderly people, and individuals with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Tourists and visitors to the city.</li>
        <li>Environmentally-conscious residents looking for eco-friendly alternatives to private vehicles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. SDG Goal Alignment</h2>
      <p>This public transport system is directly aligned with SDG Goal 11.2, which focuses on providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all. Here's how it contributes to the goal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Safe and Accessible Transport:</b> By prioritizing accessibility for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities, the bus system ensures that all individuals can safely and easily access transportation. Additionally, the system will include safety measures such as well-lit bus stops, trained staff, and surveillance for security.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainability:</b> The bus system reduces the environmental impact of individual car use, contributes to energy efficiency, and reduces road congestion, which improves the cityâ€™s overall sustainability.</li>
        <li><b>Affordability:</b> The bus system will be designed to ensure that fare prices remain low and affordable for all residents, regardless of income. This will be done by ensuring efficient route planning and scheduling to minimize operating costs and maximize capacity.</li>
        <li><b>Focus on Vulnerable Groups:</b> Special attention will be given to the mobility needs of vulnerable populations, ensuring that people with disabilities, older persons, and women can use the system with ease and safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Risk Management and Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Traffic Congestion:</b> There is a possibility that road congestion might still affect the buses. However, the development of bus-only lanes can mitigate this issue.</li>
        <li><b>Public Perception:</b> Some residents may initially resist the new system, especially those accustomed to private vehicles. Awareness campaigns and incentives for using public transport can help improve adoption.</li>
        <li><b>Funding and Maintenance:</b> Initial investment in buses and infrastructure will be significant. To mitigate this, the city will explore public-private partnerships, government funding, and long-term operational models to ensure sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h2>Relating this business case to algortims</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            we can use the the <a href="https://github.com/Sairam625/Portfolio-DAA/blob/main/pages/sairam/codes/dijkstras/dijkstras.cpp">  Dijkstra's Algorithm </a> as This algorithm is commonly used for finding the shortest path in a graph. We can use it to determine the shortest route between bus stops and optimize travel times.
