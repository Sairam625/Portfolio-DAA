        <h2>1.Public Transport Optimization  </h2>
        
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>Anandnagari's public transport system faces inefficiencies in its routing, leading to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Underutilization of buses.</li>

            <h2>Alignment with SDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
            <p>
                This business case aligns with SDG Goal 11 by contributing to sustainable urban development through efficient water management. Specifically, it addresses the following targets under Goal 11:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target 11.6:</strong> Reduce the environmental impact of cities by improving water resource management.</li>
                <p><strong>Indicator 11.6.1:</strong> Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Target 11.b:</strong> Promote sustainable practices and resilience to climate-related water challenges.</li>
                <p><strong>Indicator 11.b.1:</strong> Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Target 11.c:</strong> Support sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure development.</li>
                <p><strong>Indicator 11.c.1:</strong> Proportion of financial support to the development of sustainable and resilient infrastructure in developing countries.</p>
            </ul>

        <h2>Relating this business case to algortims</h2>
        <ul>
          <p><strong>The<a href="https://github.com/Sairam625/Portfolio-DAA/blob/main/pages/sairam/codes/kruscals.cpp">  Kruskals </a></strong>   algorithm can be used in this business case to design an optimal water distribution network by minimizing the cost of connecting all reservoirs, treatment plants, and user locations. Its edge-based approach ensures the network is built efficiently without redundancy, making it ideal for infrastructure planning. </p>
