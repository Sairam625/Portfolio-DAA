        <li>Environmentally-conscious residents looking for eco-friendly alternatives to private vehicles.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Key Benefits</h2>

      <h3>A. Economic Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Affordability:</b> Bus transportation is far cheaper than private vehicles, thus reducing the financial burden on low-income households.</li>
        <li><b>Job Creation:</b> The introduction of a large-scale bus system will create jobs for bus drivers, conductors, maintenance staff, and administrative roles.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced Traffic Congestion:</b> A dedicated bus transport system will reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to lower congestion, improved productivity, and reduced travel times.</li>
        <li><b>Increased Economic Activity:</b> Improved transportation systems make it easier for people to access work, education, healthcare, and business opportunities, boosting local economies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Social Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Accessibility for All:</b> By providing a universal public transport system, Anandnagari ensures that all residents, including those with disabilities, can access essential services, jobs, and recreational areas.</li>
        <li><b>Safer Commutes:</b> Buses offer a safer alternative to private transportation, reducing the risk of accidents caused by poorly maintained vehicles and reckless driving. This is especially important for vulnerable groups.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced Gender Inequality:</b> The availability of reliable and affordable public transport helps women access employment, education, and healthcare without relying on private transport, which may not always be safe or accessible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Environmental Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reduced Carbon Footprint:</b> A bus-only transport system will help decrease the number of private vehicles on the road, reducing overall carbon emissions and contributing to cleaner air.</li>
        <li><b>Energy Efficiency:</b> Buses, especially electric buses, are far more energy-efficient compared to individual vehicles, contributing to sustainability efforts.</li>
        <li><b>Congestion Reduction:</b> Fewer cars on the road will result in reduced air pollution, lower noise levels, and less wear and tear on roads, leading to long-term cost savings for the city.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. System Design and Implementation</h2>

      <h3>A. Fleet Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The fleet will consist of modern, fuel-efficient, and possibly electric buses, ensuring that the public transport system is not only affordable but also environmentally friendly.</li>
        <li>Buses will be designed with features to accommodate all passengers, including those with mobility challenges. Low-floor buses and designated seating for elderly passengers and people with disabilities will be included.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Routes and Schedules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The bus routes will be strategically designed to cover key areas of Anandnagari, including residential neighborhoods, business districts, educational institutions, healthcare centers, and recreational spots.</li>
        <li>The schedule will be designed to ensure buses run frequently during peak hours to cater to the daily commuters and at regular intervals during off-peak hours to accommodate everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Accessibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The bus system will prioritize accessibility for vulnerable groups such as elderly citizens, children, and people with disabilities. This includes designated bus stops, ramps, and priority seating.</li>
        <li>A mobile app will be developed for real-time tracking of buses, providing residents with accurate information regarding bus arrivals and departures.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. SDG Goal Alignment</h2>
      <p>This public transport system is directly aligned with SDG Goal 11.2, which focuses on providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all. Here's how it contributes to the goal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Safe and Accessible Transport:</b> By prioritizing accessibility for the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities, the bus system ensures that all individuals can safely and easily access transportation. Additionally, the system will include safety measures such as well-lit bus stops, trained staff, and surveillance for security.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainability:</b> The bus system reduces the environmental impact of individual car use, contributes to energy efficiency, and reduces road congestion, which improves the cityâ€™s overall sustainability.</li>
        <li><b>Affordability:</b> The bus system will be designed to ensure that fare prices remain low and affordable for all residents, regardless of income. This will be done by ensuring efficient route planning and scheduling to minimize operating costs and maximize capacity.</li>
        <li><b>Focus on Vulnerable Groups:</b> Special attention will be given to the mobility needs of vulnerable populations, ensuring that people with disabilities, older persons, and women can use the system with ease and safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Risk Management and Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Traffic Congestion:</b> There is a possibility that road congestion might still affect the buses. However, the development of bus-only lanes can mitigate this issue.</li>
        <li><b>Public Perception:</b> Some residents may initially resist the new system, especially those accustomed to private vehicles. Awareness campaigns and incentives for using public transport can help improve adoption.</li>
        <li><b>Funding and Maintenance:</b> Initial investment in buses and infrastructure will be significant. To mitigate this, the city will explore public-private partnerships, government funding, and long-term operational models to ensure sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
