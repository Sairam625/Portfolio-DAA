        <h2>1. Business Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide affordable and efficient public transport to all residents.</li>
          <li>To ensure that mobility is safe, accessible, and sustainable.</li>
          <li>To reduce the environmental impact of private transportation by offering a cleaner alternative.</li>
          <li>To provide a reliable and efficient system that supports economic activity and social inclusion.</li>
          <li>To improve connectivity and make transportation accessible to vulnerable groups (such as children,
            elderly, and disabled persons).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">

        <h2>5. SDG Goal Alignment</h2>
        <p>This public transport system is directly aligned with SDG Goal 11.2, which focuses on providing access to
          safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all. Here's how it contributes to the
          goal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Safe and Accessible Transport:</b> By prioritizing accessibility for the elderly, women, children, and
            people with disabilities, the bus system ensures that all individuals can safely and easily access
            transportation. Additionally, the system will include safety measures such as well-lit bus stops, trained
            staff, and surveillance for security.</li>
          <li><b>Sustainability:</b> The bus system reduces the environmental impact of individual car use, contributes
            to energy efficiency, and reduces road congestion, which improves the city’s overall sustainability.</li>
          <li><b>Affordability:</b> The bus system will be designed to ensure that fare prices remain low and affordable
            for all residents, regardless of income. This will be done by ensuring efficient route planning and
            scheduling to minimize operating costs and maximize capacity.</li>
          <li><b>Focus on Vulnerable Groups:</b> Special attention will be given to the mobility needs of vulnerable
            populations, ensuring that people with disabilities, older persons, and women can use the system with ease
            and safety.</li>
