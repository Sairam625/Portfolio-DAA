        <h2>1.Public Transport Optimization  </h2>
        
        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>Anandnagari's public transport system faces inefficiencies in its routing, leading to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Underutilization of buses.</li>
          <li>Increased commute times for residents.</li>
          <li>Higher operational costs due to redundant or inefficient routes.</li>
          <li>Elevated carbon emissions due to unnecessary fuel consumption.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</strong> can be used to calculate the shortest paths between all pairs of bus stops. This information helps to design optimized routes that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce travel times for passengers.</li>
          <li>Enhance the efficiency of public transport services.</li>
