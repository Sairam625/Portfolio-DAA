                <p>
                    The project addresses urban infrastructure optimization. Using concepts from the course, we analyzed
                    white papers on smart city designs to identify critical business problems, such as efficient
                    transportation systems, waste management, and energy
                    distribution.

                            Our developed city is located in India.
                            Through this project , we explore key areas such as land use,
                            transportation systems, energy efficient architecture and waste management.
                            The total allotted area for developing this city is 1500sq.km
                            Among the total we have divided the land based on public needs:
