        <h1>Automated Logistics Scheduling with Shortest Path Optimization</h1>

        <h2>Solution for the Business Case</h2>
        <p>The solution for the Business Case is Automated Logistics Scheduling with Shortest Path Optimization.</p>

        <h2>Tasks to be Performed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scheduling Slots:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Shortest Path:</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shortest Path</h3>
        <p>The truck's route is optimized based on real-time task assignments and shortest paths.</p>
        <p>The shortest path algorithm optimizes loading/unloading schedules by minimizing transit times, reducing operational costs, and ensuring efficient vehicle movement within SEZs. It prevents delays, avoids congestion, and supports dynamic traffic management, aligning with SDG goals 11.2 (sustainable transport) and 12.3 (reducing waste).</p>

        <h3>Scheduling Slots</h3>
        <p>Scheduling slots are used to schedule truck timings based on the available slots (docks).</p>
        <p>Scheduling slots are important in loading/unloading schedules because they help organize and optimize the timing of truck arrivals and departures. By assigning specific time slots for each truck, it minimizes congestion at docks, reduces waiting times, improves resource utilization (e.g., dock workers and equipment), and ensures that goods are handled efficiently and safely. This leads to smoother operations, reduced delays, and cost savings for businesses involved in logistics.</p>
