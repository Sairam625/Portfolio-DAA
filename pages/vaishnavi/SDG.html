        <h2>Business case overview</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <h3>The finalized business case with which I will be working in this course project is:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Traffic flow and logistic management within SEZ
                <ul>
                    loading/unloading schedules
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <div class="block">
        <h3>Issues with Loading/Unloading Schedules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When there are long delays between scheduled loading or unloading times, trucks and workers are idle. This happens when:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loading/unloading times are not synchronized with truck arrivals.</li>
                    <li>There is a mismatch in the time window allotted for each activity.</li>
                    <li>Delays in one task push back other tasks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multiple trucks are scheduled to load or unload at the same time at the same location (e.g., docks or warehouses). This can create congestion and result in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Trucks being delayed because they cannot access the dock or loading area.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Poor estimation of the time required for loading/unloading activities.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <div class="block">
        <h3>Effects:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Idle trucks, labor, and equipment increase overall costs for fuel, manpower, and maintenance.</li>
            <li>Delays require rescheduling, which adds to the costs of managing logistics and transportation.</li>
            <li>Delays in loading/unloading can affect delivery timelines, especially for time-sensitive goods.</li>
            <li>When tasks are delayed or rescheduled, the whole supply chain can be impacted.</li>
            <li>Trucks and equipment are often underused if schedules are not optimized. This results in the need for more assets to handle the same volume of goods.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>Business Case Relating to SDG</h2>
        <h3>Target 12.3: Halve per capita global food waste by reducing losses in production and supply chains</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Indicator 12.3.1: Food loss index.</li>
            <li><strong>Relation:</strong> Improved scheduling reduces downtime for perishable goods, minimizing losses during transit within SEZs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Target 11.2: Provide access to safe, affordable, sustainable transport systems for all</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Indicator 11.2.1: Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport.</li>
            <li><strong>Relation:</strong> Improved traffic flow in SEZs minimizes congestion, creating spillover effects of better accessibility and reducing delays for transport systems linked to the SEZ.</li>
        </ul>
