        <h1>Efficient Scheduling System</h1>
        <p>To make the scheduling system more efficient, we can apply algorithms specifically designed for job scheduling, resource allocation, or load balancing.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Greedy Algorithm for Earliest Available Slot</h2>
            <p>This algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) to store docks based on their available time. It efficiently fetches the dock with the earliest availability in <code>O(log D)</code>, where <code>D</code> is the number of docks.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Schedule trucks as they arrive using available docks.</p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Truck ID</th>
                        <th>Arrival Time</th>
                        <th>Load Time (hours)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>1</td><td>09:00</td><td>4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2</td><td>09:30</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3</td><td>10:00</td><td>2</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4</td><td>10:30</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5</td><td>11:00</td><td>3</td></tr>

            <h2>2. Interval Partitioning</h2>
            <p>This algorithm assigns trucks to docks to avoid overloading multiple trucks at the same dock simultaneously. It minimizes overlap while using the fewest docks possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Minimize overlap and use as few docks as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
            <pre>
Truck 1 scheduled from 09:00 to 13:00 at Dock 0

            <h2>3. Load Balancing</h2>
            <p>This algorithm distributes workload evenly across docks, ensuring efficient utilization of resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Distribute workload evenly across docks.</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
