        <h1>Urban Housing Allocation</h1>

        <p>The problem of Urban Housing Allocation is highly relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially targets 11.1 and 10.2. Here's how:</p>

        <h2>SDG Targets</h2>
        <h3>SDG 11.1 (Affordable Housing):</h3>
        <p>Target 11.1 aims to ensure access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services, particularly for low-income groups. In this problem, we are working towards allocating affordable housing to urban residents, ensuring that those with lower income are prioritized and that they are allocated housing that suits their needs (size, location, affordability).</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Matching Residents’ Needs with Available Housing:</strong> The challenge is to allocate the right house to each resident based on affordability, size, and proximity to services.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritizing Low-Income Groups:</strong> Ensuring that low-income residents are prioritized in housing allocation to promote fairness and equity.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Relocation Logistics for Urban Redevelopment Projects:</strong> Balancing relocation needs while considering housing affordability and proximity during urban redevelopment.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(R⋅H), where R is the number of residents and H is the number of houses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(R⋅H), for the table to store subproblem results.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(H<sup>R</sup>), where R is the number of residents and H is the number of houses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(R), for the recursion stack and storing intermediate results during exploration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Partitioning Algorithm:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Partition residents or houses based on criteria (e.g., income, family size).</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(R⋅logR + H⋅logH), if sorting is involved. Otherwise, O(R + H) for linear partitioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(R + H), to store the partitions or for auxiliary space during the process.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
